The project is a sophisticated book store application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and 
incorporates Material-UI for a sleek user interface. The primary focus is on enabling users to easily perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
on a diverse catalog of books.
